# Genetic Algorithm for Complex Polynomial Optimization of Roots on Unit Circle
(Collaborative project of Sepehr and Sohrab.)
This project started as a tool to analyze the effects of different mutation and cross-over parameters of a genetic algorithm on finding root candidates for a complex polynomial from random numbers around the unit circle.
